  <h2 align="center">Supporting the Project</h2>
  <p align="center">I made this project open source for a reason. up until launch I don't want people to need to pay for my game. I feel that it is wrong to force people to pay for an unfinished product, so until the game is finished, it will remain free of charge.<br>
  However if you do want to support the project, you can do so in one of two ways:<br><br>
  1. Spread the word - This is a FREE and powerful way to help the project, the more people that know the beter :D<br>
  2. Donate to the project on Ko-Fi - <a href="https://ko-fi.com/thattakashi">https://ko-fi.com/thattakashi</a></p>
